### "Synthetic Data Generation for Credit Card Risk Assessment" or "Generative Models for Synthetic Credit Card Data and Risk Assessment." 

This project aims to leverage generative models to create synthetic credit card datasets that closely resemble real-world data, 
enabling the development and evaluation of credit card risk assessment models.
